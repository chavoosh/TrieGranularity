# TrieGranularity
**TrieGranularity** is a free open source software, including four main programs:
- bit-level trie
- character-level trie
- component-level trie
- name generator

The main goal of this project is to provide a fair environment to compare three well-known trie granularities with
each other and clear their strengthes and weaknesses. Each trie, tries to make a trade off between speed and memory
usage (as well as the structural complextity).
