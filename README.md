# TrieGranularity
**TrieGranularity** is a free open source project, including four main programs:
- bit-level trie
- character-level trie
- component-level trie
- name generator

The main goal of this project is to provide a fair environment to compare three well-known trie granularities with
each other and clear their strengthes and weaknesses. Each trie, tries to make a trade off between speed and memory
usage as well as structural complextity.

We also introduce NameGen, a program to generate a dataset of NDN/CCN-like names. This tool provides end-users with numbers of options to tune the characterstics of the generated dataset.
