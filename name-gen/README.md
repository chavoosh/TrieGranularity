# NameGen

As NDN names employ URL-like structures, we first use our simple and fast URL collector tool (see folder MyCrawler)
to provide a dataset of URLs for feeding NameGen, our name generator tool.

NameGen can then learn this (or any other) dataset, extract statistical information, and generates close-to-real NDN names.
